ABOUT
=====

...a tool that provides an overview of the time spent in daily activites.

For those also working in a company where logging hours is not only part of 
continuous improvement but also making sure your hours sum up to 40 at the  
end of the week, this app may also be used as a time logger before the  
translation into your managers' favorite time-logging software. 


FIRST PHASE (CURRENT)
=====================

A simple display of the current date and time (NOW section), as well as a 
section to enter time durations and view those durations chronologically.


TODO
====

- [ ] Prototype (without logic) of the NOW and LOG-EDITING sections
- [ ] Decision about the save logic (HTML5 FileSystem API, NodeJS)
- [ ] Prototype logic
